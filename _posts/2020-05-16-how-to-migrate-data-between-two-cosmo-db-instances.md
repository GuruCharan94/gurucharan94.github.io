I have previously written about [Cosmos DB utility tools that you cannot miss](https://www.gurucharan.in/azure/cosmos-db-tools-that-improve-your-productivity/). Cosmos DB Data Migrator is the one I use most if I have to move data around across multiple instances of CosmosDB. Here is a simple script I wrote to migrate data from the source database to a target instance of Azure Cosmos DB.

```powershell

$cosmosCollections = @(
  "collection1",
  "collection2",
  "yetanothercollection",
  "ThisIsTheLastOneIPromise"
  );

### Settings for Prod
$sourceConnectionString = "AccountEndpoint=<sourceendpoint>;AccountKey=<sourcekey>;Database=<sourcedatabase>"
$targetConnectionString = "AccountEndpoint=<targetendpoint>;AccountKey=<targetkey>;Database=<targetdatabase>"

$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "MM-dd-yyyy-HH-mm-ss"

foreach ($collection in $cosmosCollections)
{
  Write-Host "Starting Migration of $collection"
  $file = "./migration-$timestamp-$collection.log"
  Start-Process -Wait -NoNewWindow -RedirectStandardOutput $file -FilePath "\path\to\executable\dt.exe" `
                -ArgumentList "/ProgressUpdateInterval:00:00:05 /s:DocumentDB /s.Collection:$collection /s.ConnectionString:$sourceConnectionString /s.InternalFields /t:DocumentDBBulk /t.DisableIdGeneration /t.Collection:$collection /t.ConnectionString:$targetConnectionString"

  Write-Host "End Migration of $collection"
}
```

You can save this script in your computer. Once you execute this file, you will see logs that shows you how many records were migrated

There is no value in keeping this hidden on a folder in my hard drive, is there ? So, I made it public. I am pretty sure that I will do an internet search for this later ðŸ˜Ž. Hopefully, you will find this useful as well.
