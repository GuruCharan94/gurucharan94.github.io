This blog post is a collection of public speaking tips for developers. The tips include how to respond to a CFP (Call for Papers), how to structure your talk, how to design your slides, preparing good demos and how to deal with anxiety and prepare for failure.

## Tips to get your talk accepted

Conferences, Local Meetups, User Group events all have a call for papers (CFP). Writing a good proposal is paramount to getting accepted. A convincing abstract, professional head-shot, and an impressive bio will surely improve your chances of getting through. Below are some tips that I found useful.
